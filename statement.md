##  Problem Statement

Managing room reservations manually in hotels often leads to confusion, lost records, double booking, and difficulty in tracking guest history. A systematic solution is required to simplify operations and store data safely with quick access.

##  Scope of the Project

This project focuses on building a simple console-based Hotel Management System capable of handling basic room operations. It includes real-time room status tracking and persistent storage using JSON files so that data remains even after the program is closed.

The scope covers:

* Room allocation and release
* Guest details recording
* Basic reporting of room availability

Advanced functionalities like billing, multi-user access, and graphical UI are not included in the current version but may be added in future upgrades.
